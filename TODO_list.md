# TODO List for Future Revisions and Enhancements

## 1. **Branch Management**
   - [ ] **Refactor Branch References**: Rename `branch_ref` to something more descriptive, like `branch_states` or `branch_info`, to make the code's purpose clearer.
   - [ ] **Ensure Consistent Branch Switching**: Double-check that switching branches doesn't introduce unexpected state changes, particularly when dealing with parent messages.

## 2. **Error Handling**
   - [ ] **Add Robust Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases, such as missing branches or message IDs, and handle cases where the parent message is not found.
   - [ ] **Invalid Branch Names**: Validate branch names to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not conflict with reserved keywords.

## 3. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] **Optimize Message Retrieval**: Consider using a dictionary to index messages by their ID for O(1) retrieval in the `get_message` method, especially for large threads.
   - [ ] **Improve Efficiency of Branch Updates**: Review the `update_branches_in_message` method to ensure it operates efficiently even as the thread size grows.

## 4. **Documentation and Usability**
   - [ ] **Expand Docstrings**: Add more detailed explanations and example usages to each method's docstring to improve usability for other developers.
   - [ ] **Create a Usage Guide**: Develop a markdown file or documentation page that outlines how to use the `DialogicAI` class, including examples of common tasks.

## 5. **Testing and Validation**
   - [ ] **Write Unit Tests**: Create unit tests for all methods, covering a variety of scenarios to ensure robust functionality.
   - [ ] **Edge Case Testing**: Ensure that tests cover edge cases, such as adding messages to an empty thread, switching branches, and handling invalid input.

## 6. **Additional Features**
   - [ ] **Branch Merging and Splitting**: Consider adding methods to handle merging and splitting branches, allowing more advanced management of the conversation thread.
   - [ ] **Traversal Methods**: Implement methods for traversing the thread in different orders (e.g., depth-first, breadth-first) to support various use cases.
   - [ ] **Branch History Tracking**: Add functionality to track the history of branch changes, which could be useful for understanding the evolution of a conversation.

## 7. **Refactoring**
   - [ ] **Simplify `add_message` Method**: Review the `add_message` method for potential simplifications, particularly in how it handles metadata and branches.
   - [ ] **Centralize Metadata Handling**: Consider creating a helper function or class method for handling metadata creation and updates, reducing redundancy in the code.

## 8. **User Interface Integration**
   - [ ] **Prepare for UI Integration**: Begin considering how this class could integrate with a UI, such as through REST APIs or direct frontend frameworks, to make it more versatile in application.

## 9. **Versioning and Releases**
   - [ ] **Prepare for Version 1.0.0**: As these features are completed, prepare for the first official release, ensuring all features are documented, tested, and stable.

### Future Considerations:
   - [ ] **Concurrency Handling**: If the application will support concurrent users or processes, consider adding thread-safety mechanisms.
   - [ ] **Data Persistence**: Plan for how the thread data will be persisted (e.g., in a database), and consider adding serialization/deserialization methods.
